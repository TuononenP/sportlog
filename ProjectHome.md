<p>This project is a <b>website/database</b> combination that acts as a conventional way to <b>log physical exercises</b> by individuals or groups such as football teams. It contains the most necessary things to log. Afterwards it's a great source of information for coaches and keep-fit enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made that the communication between the site and the database layer is <b>secure</b> (e.g. precautions for SQL injection, only stored procedures are executed, access permissions separated for multiple users etc).</p>

<p>Implemented with <b>PHP & MySQL</b>.</p>
